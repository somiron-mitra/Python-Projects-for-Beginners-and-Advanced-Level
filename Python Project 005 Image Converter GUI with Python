# Image Converter GUI with Python

# Machine Learning Project using Python Programming.


# A large number of image file formats are available for storing graphic data, the most popular being JPG and PNG. 
# In this project, I will take you through how to create an image converter GUI with Python to convert PNG to JPG.

# To create an Image converter GUI with Python, 
# I will use the Tkinter library in Python which is the best known Python framework for building GUI application. 
# Other than Tkinter we also need PIL library in Python which stands for Python Imaging Library.


# Now letâ€™s see how to create an application to convert a PNG image to JPG:

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
from PIL import Image

root = tk.Tk()
canvas1 = tk.Canvas(root, width=300, height=250, bg='azure3', relief='raised')
canvas1.pack()

label1 = tk.Label(root, text="Image Converter", bg='azure3')
label1.config(font=('helvetica', 20))
canvas1.create_window(150, 60, window=label1)

def getPNG():
    global im1
    import_file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename()
    im1 = Image.open(import_file_path)

browse_png = tk.Button(text="Select PNG file", command=getPNG, bg="royalblue", fg='white', font=('helvetica', 12, 'bold'))
canvas1.create_window(150, 130, window=browse_png)

def convert():
    global im1
    export_file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension='.jpg')
    im1.save(export_file_path)

saveasbutton = tk.Button(text="Convert PNG to JPG", command=convert, bg='royalblue', fg='white', font=('helvetica', 12, 'bold'))
canvas1.create_window(150, 180, window=saveasbutton)
root.mainloop()


# As you can see the output window, it will work the same as all other applications installed in your system. 

# You first need to select a PNG file then click on the button to convert PNG to JPG, 
# then you just need to select a folder where you want to save your converted image. 
# This is how we can easily create a GUI application to convert Images.
