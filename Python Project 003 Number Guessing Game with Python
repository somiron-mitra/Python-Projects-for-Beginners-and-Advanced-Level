# Number Guessing Game with Python

# In this project, I will walk you through how to create a number guessing game with the programming language Python.

# A guessing game includes handling user input, using the if statement as well as looping constructs.

# How Number Guessing Game Works?

# A number guessing game aims to guess the number that the program has come up with. 
# Essentially the program logic is:

#  1.   The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 or any other combination of numbers.
#  2.   It will then ask the player to enter his proposal.
#  3.   It will then check if this number is the same as the one generated randomly by the computer; if so, 
#      the player wins.
#  4.   If the player’s guess is not the same, 
#      then he will check if the number is higher or lower than the guess and tell the player.

# Now let’s see how to create a guessing game with Python

# Number Guessing Game with Python:

# to import random module
import random
# to create a range of random numbers between 1-10
n = random.randrange(1,100)
# to take a user input to enter a number
guess = int(input("Enter any number: "))
while n!= guess: # means if n is not equal to the input guess
    # if guess is smaller than n
    if guess < n:
        print("Too low")
        # to again ask for input
        guess = int(input("Enter number again: "))
    # if guess is greater than n
    elif guess > n:
        print("Too high!")
        # to again ask for the user input
        guess = int(input("Enter number again: "))
    # if guess gets equals to n terminate the while loop
    else:
        break
print("you guessed it right!!")




# Output

# Enter any number: 67
# Too high!
# Enter number again: 45
# Too low
# Enter number again: 50
# Too low
# Enter number again: 55
# Too high!
# Enter number again: 52
# Too low
# Enter number again: 54
# you guessed it right!!
