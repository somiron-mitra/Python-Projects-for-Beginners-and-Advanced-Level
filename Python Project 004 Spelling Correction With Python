# Correct Spellings with Python
# Python Program To Correct Spellings 
# This is one of the examples of how we use Python programming in "Machine Learning". 


# In this project, we will see how to write a program to correct spellings with Python programming language. 
# For this task, I will use an NLP library in Python known as TextBlob.


# What is TextBlob?

# TextBlob is a Python library for processing text data. 
# It provides a simple API for delving into common natural language processing tasks such as tagging part of speech, 
# extracting nominal sentences, analyzing feelings, classifying, translating, and more.


# It provides some very useful features for Machine Learning projects like:

# 1.    Noun phrase extraction
# 2.    Part-of-speech tagging
# 3.    Sentiment analysis
# 4.    Classification
# 5.    Tokenization
# 6.    Word and phrase frequencies
# 7.    Parsing
# 8.    n-grams
# 9.    Word inflexion and lemmatization
# 10.   Spelling correction
# 11.   Add new models or languages through extensions
# 12.   WordNet integration



# We can simply install the TextBlob library in your systems by writing a pip command; pip install textblob.



# Now, we will see how to write a Python program to correct spellings:

from textblob import TextBlob
words = ["Machne", "Learnin"]
corrected_words = []
for i in words:
    corrected_words.append(TextBlob(i))
print("Wrong words :", words)
print("Corrected Words are :")
for i in corrected_words:
    print(i.correct(), end=" ")
    
    
# OUTPUT
#   Wrong words : ['Machne', 'Learnin']
#   Corrected Words are :
#   Machine Learning 



# So this is how we can write a python program using the TextBlob library for correcting spellings. 
# This feature can be used in Natural language processing projects in Machine Learning.
