# A chessboard is the type of game board used for the game of chess, on which pawns and chess pieces are placed. 
# A chessboard is usually square, with an alternating pattern of squares of two colours.
# In this project, I’ll walk you through how to create and visualize a chessboard with the Python programming language.

# To create a chessboard with the Python programming language, 
# I will use two Python libraries; Matplotlib for visualization, and NumPy for building an algorithm which will help us to create and visualize a chessboard. 



# Let’s see how we can code to create and visualize a chessboard:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm

dx, dy = 0.015, 0.05
x = np.arange(-4.0, 4.0, dx)
y = np.arange(-4.0, 4.0, dy)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
extent = np.min(x), np.max(x), np.min(y), np.max(y)
z1 = np.add.outer(range(8), range(8)) % 2
plt.imshow(z1, cmap="binary_r", interpolation="nearest", extent=extent, alpha=1)

def chess(x, y):
    return (1 - x / 2 + x ** 5 + y ** 6) * np.exp(-(x ** 2 + y ** 2))
z2 = chess(X, Y)
plt.imshow(z2, alpha=0.7, interpolation="bilinear", extent=extent)
plt.title("Chess Board with Python")
plt.show()
