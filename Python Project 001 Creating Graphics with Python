# Creating Graphics with Python

# Creating Graphics in Python using Turtle module. 

# In Python, Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming. 
# Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. 
# After an import turtle, 
# give it the command turtle.forward(15), and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the direction it is facing, 
# drawing a line as it moves. Give it the command turtle.right(25), and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise.
# By combining together these and similar commands, intricate shapes and pictures can easily be drawn.

# Now lets make a graphic using python turtle module:

import turtle

colors=['red','purple','blue','green','orange','yellow']

t=turtle.Pen()

turtle.bgcolor('black')

for x in range(360):

    t.pencolor(colors[x%6])

    t.width(x/100+1)

    t.forward(x)

    t.left(59)
